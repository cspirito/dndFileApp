1) Setup an Amazon S3 Account
2) Add your S3 Credentials to config/s3.yml
3) Update your jQuery loading to your desired place.  I loaded jQuery through Google - but I don't do that any more.
4) There is probably stuff I am forgetting - but this is just something I coded in about 45 minutes to show how this works.
